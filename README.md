## what it does
* hides text in images (like my feelings)
* extracts hidden text (why would you want to read it anyway)
* runs as desktop app (because websites aren't lonely enough)

## setup (if you care)
```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/user/StealthText
# install electron (because we have to)
npm install electron
# run (or don't)
electron .
```

## requirements
- Node.js (v16+ if you're living in the future)
- Electron (RAM isn't free, but here we are)
- Images to ruin
- Secret messages no one will read

## known issues
- everything
- package.json missing (like my hopes and dreams)
- electron eating RAM for breakfast
